## Project Description

ClubDeCuentos was made in a 6 month Full-Stack Bootcamp, this was a real and an outstanding project. We didnt have a designer to guide us so we decided how its going to look at the end. The main purpose of this project was to create e-books with characters personalized by the end users. We didnt get the e-book on time but the personalized character we did.
